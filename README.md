#Installation
1. make sure your bot has perms 
2. MAKE SURE YOUR BOT HAS "PRESENCE INTENT" AND "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" ENABLED, UNDER THE BOT TAB IN DISCORD DEVELOPER PORTAL
3. enter your token in token.txt
4. enable discord developer mode and copy&paste the guild id
5. enjoy

#Notes
If it constantly prints "rate limited" when spamming roles, that means you have been rate limied for 24 hours. Im guessing this is due to the sensitive api.
To kick or ban members, you need to type ">scrape" in any channel of your desired server each time.
